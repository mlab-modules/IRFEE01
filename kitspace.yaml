summary: The sensor uses modulated infrared signal for distant detection of obstacles.
  It mmaybe seen as virtual feeler for roboot. The sensor uses processor ATtiny and
  infraredsensor for remote control. The modulation and statistical processing of
  the signalgives the sensor good noise imunity.
